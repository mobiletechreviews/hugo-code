Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is the best phone that will make you fall in love with it. In recent days it is the most trending phone in the mobile market you will find. It has larger screen size 6.2 inches compared to any phone launched in recent years. The other variant Samsung Galaxy S8 has a screen size of 5.8 inches. Both this phones are almost same in many aspects if compared.

You need to hold this phone very carefully with both your hands because of its big size. If you love bigger screen phone than you can buy this phone or else for smaller screen size phone you would love to buy Samsung galaxy S8. Both the galaxy phones can survive a dip of water up to 1m for 30 minutes. Samsung company is gearing up for a great competition against its rivalry iPhone, Xiaomi , Oppo and Xperia phone companies in terms of bigger screen phones in better price. For a span of time all the Samsung users were loosing hope in the Samsung company because the Samsung galaxy note 7 phones were exploding but it now seems that Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ has been restoring the faith in the users once again. 

## Design and Display

There is no doubt that this is the best looking phone that i have ever seen. It is really making iPhone users jealous in terms of its flawless looks. If you are going to buy this phone then i would like to tell you to put your money on the Midnight Black because it looks too sexy you will love it to look again and again its so addictive. And if you are going to cover this phone than you might be degrading its beauty, i would recommend you to use trasparent back cover.  The Samsung Galaxy S8s are refined and polished to a literal shine.

The Samsung has worked its screen size giving more inches to it but also keeping in mind that the overall size remains constant. This aids the user to carry the phone easily and at the same time they can enjoy the content on the larger display. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and the S8+ comes with Infinity Display to solve the common problem.  On the Galaxy S8, it measures 5.8 inches diagonally from rounded corner to rounded corner; on the S8 Plus it expands to 6.2 inches in the same dimension.

The Samsung Galaxy edges are cut in to curved edges which makes it look more pleasing to the eyes. Samsung has worked lot on its edges to make it look better and flawless, earlier there use to be lot of problem with the edges of Samsung device it was unplesant to look and handle but samsung has overcome this problem with S8 and S8+. The users will love to play games with high graphics without any lagging problem. Watching movies on the device would be fascinating as it will fully fit on the screen easily.

The finger print scanner of S8+ is on the backside of the phone which makes you to stretch your palm to open it which i hate. Apart from this, the whole hardware of the S8+ is flawless and quiet appealing. The S8 and S8 Plus use USB Type-C ports for wired charging and data transfer, and both phones include a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. 

## Description

![](http://imgur.com/mIJ6j0y.png)

Samsungs TouchWiz UI has taken a lot of failure but the new version is smoother, faster and not cluttered. Al least, there is no need to download another launcher.

The new UI comes on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. The home screen is simple with a handful of app shortcuts and a nice big weather widget front and center. You only need a quick swipe up and you will enter the app tray, a swipe up again and you are back to the home screen.
The settings menu is similarly straightforward and easy to navigate, and includes a search function to find anything within it. If you dig deep into the settings, you will find an endless array of options and configurations, from customizing the order of the on-screen buttons to themes that can alter the appearance of virtually every aspect of the phone. Other touches, like the slick, pill-shaped notification bubble that pops up at the top of the screen when an alert comes in, or the customizable always-on display are things I wish were available in all versions of Android, not just Samsung’s.

The interesting part is that Samsung has also put some nice themes and effects for the phone. There are small features like data saving built into its browser. Also the phone comes with Blue Light filter to help consumers read more in dark conditions.                                 

## Bixby and its button

Samsung has built its own digital assistant called Bixby and has put a dedicated button for the assistant. Bixby now comes without voice commands and is currently reduced to a HTC Sense Companion-like assistant. Bixby rides on third-party services such as Twitter, Facebook, Spotify, and Foursquare, and  it can tell you the weather, upcoming appointments, news updates, or reminders you’ve set.

Bixby also shows up in the camera and gallery app, providing functionality that is very similar to what Amazon already offers in its app and what Google Goggles has done for years. Bixby Vision, it uses computer vision to identify an object or text and then links you to similar images on Pinterest or options to buy more of the same product from Amazon. It uses Google Translate to translate text, much like how the proper Google Translate app does. It can identify landmarks and provide links and facts about them or tell you all about the bottle of wine you’re about to open. It is not possible to remap the Bixby button on the S8 to do something more useful.

## Performance

The Galaxy S8 and S8+ is very fast like a blink of an eye. I bet you that you will be loving its camera quality. The pictures taken from the phone are very clean and clear. In European country the phone comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, the Asian version comes withe Samsung’s Exynos 8895 processor which is an equivalent of the Snapdragon 835. While the S8 was blazing fast, it tilts off a little when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus in app launch time. The real question is will it slowdown after months of usage no we think not. Samsung S8s come with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot for expansion, and a radio capable of both gigabit LTE and gigabit Wi-Fi. The S8 and S8+ is the first gigabit LTE smartphone you can buy, but until we have actual gigabit networks to use it on, that doesn’t matter all that much.

The S8 and S8+ is also the first phone to come with Bluetooth 5.0, which promises better range and the ability to deliver audio to two different Bluetooth devices at the same time. I was able to get the same song from YouTube to simultaneously play out of two sets of Bluetooth headphones, though you could also use it to have two Bluetooth speakers play the same audio. Samsung has upgraded its software processing, using similar techniques as Apple and Google to provide better detailed images in low light, but the differences between this year’s camera and last year’s are negligible at best. I was particulary not unhappy with the battery backups of the S8s but it could improve a lot. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ has a better backup than the S8. The smaller S8 has a 3,000mAh battery, while the S8 Plus jumps to a 3,500mAh cell.

The smaller model can last an entire day between charges if you’re a light user, but if you use your phone a lot, you will likely have to charge it at some point in the day. The larger S8 Plus might be the better option for heavy users, it was more likely to last me a full day before it needed to be plugged in.
