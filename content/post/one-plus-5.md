#### Why should you buy this phone?

OnePlus 5 is a fabulous phone, presently the best phone in the industry. And its price adds cherry on the cake. The OnePlus 5 at any given price would be a good phone. And its starting price of Rs 32,999 makes it even better for the buyers. I would like to term this phone as an all-rounder that might not have one best-in-class feature but as an overall phone, comes together very well.

If you really want to buy it, ignore the fake news about the phone which is trying to detoriate its beauty, take a look at the price of the OnePlus 5, features and performance then buy it. You will most likely be very happy with this phone and its looks. 


#### What about its design?

There are various things that OnePlus has changed with OnePlus 5 if you compare it with the previous version of OnePlus. OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T which had industrial designs and sharp edges gathering users attention but beside this the OnePlus 5 has been influenced by Apple iPhone 7 you can say that its design looks similar to iPhone 7. It has got similar edges like iPhone 7 instead of Apple logo it has got square logo that makes it OnePlus otherwise you may call it is Apple product.

OnePlus 5 has display size screen of 5.5 inch and same thickness as that of Apple iPhone 7 but it is lighter in weight as compare to it. The more you use the more you will feel its thoughtful touches, its so loving that you will keeping touching it, it will give you great pleasure. It is combined with premium built quality and the whole phone is made up single alluminium alloy.

#### Camera quality of OnePlus 5?

![](http://imgur.com/M2g1ysH.png)

Now lets talk about the camera quality of OnePlus 5. Recent days there has been lot of discussion on the camera of the OnePlus 5 as it has not been very decisive. The camera of OnePlus 5 is good but not outstanding as people had more expectation from the dual camera of OnePlus 5. 

Let me make clear every thing. The OnePlus 5 has two rear cameras on the back. One of them is a 16-megapixel shooter with regular lens. This lens has a focal length of around 25mm and a wide F1.7 lens. The camera of OnePlus 5 uses the Sony-made IMX 398 image sensor. If we talk about sensor quality, there is nothing special about the IMX 398. Then there is the other camera. This one uses a 20-megapixel sensor paired with IMX 350 image sensor. The lens on this camera uses F2.6 aperture. This is not good for low light and it shows. 

If there is more light in the surrounding the 16 mega pixel camera clicks better picture but lacks the picture quality if compared with Samsung galaxy 8. You may find 16 mega pixel camera clicks picture same as iPhone 7. In low light OnePlus 5 uses special feature or algorithm to capture image clearly. The 20 mega pixel camera performs good in sunlight but you will see it failing in low light. This is the disadvantage of OnePlus 5. If you zoom the pictures you will see blur backgrounds that is where it will make you think once again. But don't worry its not that bad its better but not the best.

#### Performance of OnePlus 5?

You will be surprised to see its performance as fast as horse. The reason why OnePlus 3 or OnePlus 3T is so popular because they are very fast and accurate . The OnePlus 5 is no differnt. It is very fast phone in evry aspect even in high quality games also.

The OnePlus 5 is powered with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. This is the top-end mobile processor with eight cores and the top speed of 2.3GHz. It has got 6GB RAM inside it. It has got 64GB internal storage. There is another variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB internal storage but purely from the performance point of view, both phones are similar. The only big advantage that the higher-priced variant of the OnePlus 5 gives you is the extra storage. This phone does not lag it very smooth functioning phone. Animations of the phones are also smooth . You can easily switch from one task to other easily, that forces me to term this phone best in multitasking. OnePlus has added a few features to the screen. You can opt between the onscreen buttons and the physical touch buttons. This is so totally useful. You can also switch the position of back and menu button to match how it was on your earlier phone so your fingers don't have to relearn the position of these important buttons.
